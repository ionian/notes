Trying to setup someone's development containers, which are ubuntu bases with various development kits inside.  All of the setup is hosted in this repo https://github.com/bobpace/devbox .  If someone wants a tour through this with me, could you try to clone this repo and run 'make' to build the images?  I'm having an issue starting the ssh into his 'x11dockerhost'.  Apparently once you get 'x11dockerhost' running, you can access other containers via ssh.  I know getting into and out of containers via ssh is not preferred, but this one is kind of a challenge for me to get working.  I'm stuck at getting my public key authenticated with my private key.  In his readme file on github, I've put the key into the agent, and also set up my keys into github (where the makefile grabs during build, but after issueing the 'docker run -d --name x11dockerhost -p 2222:22 /bobpace/x11dockerhost' I get a "permission denied (publickey)".  Let me know if someone wants to give it a try for 15min.
